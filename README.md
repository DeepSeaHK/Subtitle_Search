# Subtitle_Search
Subtitle keyword search tool
Subtitle Keyword Finder is a practical Windows application developed using Python, designed specifically to accelerate the video editing process. Finding specific lines of dialogue or keywords within hours of footage can be incredibly time-consuming for editors. This tool eliminates that tedious task by enabling users to search directly within subtitle files. By importing a video's corresponding subtitle file, users can instantly locate exact phrases or words, complete with their precise timestamps.
Core Functionality:
Subtitle File Import: Easily add and manage standard subtitle files (e.g., SRT, VTT, ASS) associated with your video projects.
Keyword Search: Perform rapid and efficient keyword searches across the entire text content of the imported subtitles.
Precise Location Pinpointing: Instantly identifies and highlights the exact line(s) where the keyword appears within the subtitle file.
Timestamp Display: Clearly shows the corresponding start and end timecodes (timestamps) for each found instance of the keyword, allowing for quick navigation in video editing software.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a clean and intuitive interface designed for ease of use on the Windows platform.
Key Benefit:
Dramatically reduces the time spent manually scrubbing through video footage to find specific dialogue moments. This significantly boosts productivity and workflow efficiency for video editors, content creators, and anyone working with time-based media and transcripts.
Target Audience:
Video editors, content creators, YouTubers, filmmakers, journalists, researchers, and anyone who needs to quickly locate specific spoken content within video files using subtitles.
